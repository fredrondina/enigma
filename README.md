# enigma

Functionality: 3 (finished encrypt, decrypt, and CLI)

OOP: 3 Enigma class contains everything needed to encrypt and decrypt a message. The KeyGen class has everything needed to auto generate a key as well as get todays date.

Ruby Convention 3 - 2.5 Everything seems to be named appropriately Encrypt and decrypt methods are 15 + lines, could be refactored better. And a hash is used in a logical sense

TDD 3 100% test coverage, and all helper methods are tested, no mocks or stubs used

Version Control 4: 40 + commits, tests always written before methods, commit made every time a test passes. Git branches broken up by functionality being worked on.
